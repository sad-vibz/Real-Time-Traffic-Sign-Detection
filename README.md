# Real-Time Traffic Sign Detection:
This project performs real-time detection of Indian traffic signs using a webcam and a pre-trained object detection model.

# How it works
The script captures frames from your webcam, detects traffic signs in each frame using a model, and displays the detected signs with labels and confidence scores in real time.

# Requirements
 > Python 3.8+
 > OpenCV
 > A trained YOLO object detection model (model_1) compatible with your code
 > Ultralytics YOLOv8 (if applicable)

## You can install the required packages using:
pip install opencv-python

pip install ultralytics

# Class Labels
This project uses a list of 70+ Indian traffic sign classes (from Stop and Speed Limit signs to No Parking and School Zone).

### make sure to replace 'model_1' with your own model or just do it with this model itself :)
